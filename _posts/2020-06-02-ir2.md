I've been meaning to mod this Sony cybershot point and shoot camera for some time now and finally got around to it. It's a convenient camera to have converted since it's pretty small and can take landscapes more easily then my converted cell phone. Unfortunately it's limited in terms of manual options and can only give .jpeg as output. Overall it was easier and I'm happy with how this went. There were no instructions online so I will document this in case anyone else tries to do this!

## Tools

- Tiny screwdriver (that's it !)

## Instructions

First remove the 8 external screws holding the fron tof the case on. There was actually a guide online for the maintenance of this camera that failed to mention the 2 screws hidden below the flash! I almost destroyed the camera because of that so make sure all of the screws are out before attempting to remove

Next pry the case off at the bottom of the camera. I used a screwdriver for this but if you have some kind of plastic lever that would be ideal. This camera is now like $20 on ebay so I wasn't worried about scratching it.

Be careful not to touch the now exposed capacitors while you are doing this to avoid getting electrocuted. You should probably discharge them if you have the tools, I just carefully avoided all of that stuff.

Next, it's possible to sneak the entire lens assembly/sensor out without further disassembling anything as in the pic. I have no idea if this is the right way to disassemble this, probably not, but watch out for the red eye reduction light at top right which is a little in the way.

After that , it's just a matter of removing those 2 screws and you have access to the IR filter. It is not glued in or anything so quite wasy to remove. EIther replace this filter with one of your choice or for full spectrum conversion, remove the filter along with the little plastic piece and metal piece that holds them in. I first left those 2 black pieces in but they can get dislodged and block the sensor.

Now you are done! Make sure there is no dust in there, replace the screws and put it back together! Way easier than converting a cell phone camera imo.

Here a a few quick pics I took showing how it works. Unfortunately, since it exports 10m jpeg as the max resolution file size (no RAW) it's hard to really edit these pictures. I've found they can actually look okay out of the camera with just white balancing and a little tweaking in lightroom and can still achieve the pink foliage and blue sky look. Not ideal but I'll take it.
