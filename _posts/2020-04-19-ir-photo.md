During these strange times, I'm finding myself drawn to some past interests like photography. I found an old SLR which I'm planning to use once I have the right batteries. Another thing I am experimenting with is IR photography. Most camera sensors have an infrared filter which lets light in the visible spectrum through while filtering out light in the IR range. Simply removing this filter allows you to take some great photos!
