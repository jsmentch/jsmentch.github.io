I've been cloistered not only by the coronavirus, but also by spring allergies (tree pollen in particular) making it tough to stay active while avoiding the outdoors. To stay fit I've been using some old p90X3 videos and [bodyweight fitness routines](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) and installed a set of rings in our basement. I realized that a pull up bar would be a great addition and not too difficult to set up given the existing exposed i-beams.

## Tools

I did this with pretty simple equipment.

- wrench set
- locking pliers
- hack saw (for metal threaded bars)

## Materials

I purchased all of the equipment from home depot with home delivery. It took over a month to arrive! Should have done store pick-up in hindsight, the tree pollen is almost gone. You can use a different diameter pipe based on preference.

- 1x The Plumber's Choice 1 in.x 36 in. Black Steel Pipe ($17.27)
- 1x Everbilt 3/8 in. x 12 in. Zinc Threaded Rod ($1.52)
- 2x Everbilt 3/8 in.-16 Zinc Plated Nylon Lock Nut ($2.18)
- 2x Oatey 1 in. Galvanized Split Ring Tubing Hanger ($3.92)
- 2x Oatey 3/8 in. Top Beam Clamp ($5.34)

Total cost: $30.23

## Instructions

The hardest part was cutting the threaded rod in half with the hack saw. After that, it's just a matter of putting things together and tightening everything with the wrenches. Below is a picture showing how this all came together.
