I am a lab tech in the <a class="text-accent" href="https://www.robertsonlab.com/">Robertson Lab</a> at Dartmouth and the <a class="text-accent" href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml">Kanwisher Lab</a> at MIT (I am working with Caroline Robertson who was a post-doc in the KanLab and has now started her own lab at Dartmouth!). My projects are focused on visual salience, perception, and attention in ASD, and I've had the opportunity to use exciting tools like VR eye-tracking, machine learning, binocular rivalry, and neuroimaging to explore these topics.

I was in the Dartmouth <a class="text-accent" href="https://music.dartmouth.edu/graduate">Digital Musics</a> master's program and have previously worked in the fascinating fields of <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.abingtonneurology.com/">Alzheimer's disease clinical trials</a>, <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/crf2/index.html">deep-sea marine biology</a>, <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.quanttera.com/aboutus.html">microelectronics</a>, and <a class="text-accent" href="https://caglab.org/">genomics</a>. In my free time, I enjoy writing and producing <a class="text-accent" href="https://soundcloud.com/sweatercore">music</a>, creating audio-visual art projects, and thinking about cool things to do with data/the brain/machine learning!

I take lots of pictures of a tibetan spaniel named <a class="text-accent" href="https://www.instagram.com/jshoonm/">Fran√ßois</a>.
