I currently work as a lab tech in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department at MIT under the direction of [Caroline Robertson](https://www.robertsonlab.com/) in the [Kanwisher Lab](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml). My projects are focused on visual salience, perception, and attention in ASD, and I've had the opportunity to use cool tools like VR eye-tracking, binocular rivalry, and neuroimaging to study these topics.

I was in the Dartmouth [Digital Musics](https://music.dartmouth.edu/graduate) master's program before moving to Boston and have previously explored (to varying degrees) the fascinating fields of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials, marine biology, bioacoustics, microelectronics, and proteomics. In my free time, I enjoy writing and producing [music](https://soundcloud.com/sweatercore "Here are some sweater inspired beats."), creating audio-visual art projects, and thinking about cool things to do with data/the brain/machine learning!
