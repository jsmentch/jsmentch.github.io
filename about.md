I am a lab manager in the <a class="text-accent" href="https://www.robertsonlab.com/">Robertson Lab</a> at Dartmouth based out of the <a class="text-accent" href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml">Kanwisher Lab</a> at MIT. My current projects are focused on visual salience, perception, and attention in ASD, and I've had the opportunity to use exciting tools like VR eye-tracking, machine learning, binocular rivalry, and neuroimaging to explore these topics. I'm very excited to bring these experiences and techniques to my passions in music, sound, and multisensory perception.

I was in the Dartmouth <a class="text-accent" href="https://music.dartmouth.edu/graduate">Digital Musics</a> master's program and have previously worked in the <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.abingtonneurology.com/">Alzheimer's disease clinical trials</a>, <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/crf2/index.html">deep-sea marine biology</a>, <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.quanttera.com/aboutus.html">microelectronics</a>, and <a class="text-accent" href="https://caglab.org/">genomics</a>. In my free time, I enjoy writing and producing <a class="text-accent" href="https://soundcloud.com/sweatercore">music</a>, creating audio-visual art projects, and thinking about cool things to do with data/the brain/machine learning!

This fall I will be joining the <a class="text-accent" href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/shbt/">the Harvard-MIT Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT)</a>!

I take lots of pictures of a tibetan spaniel named <a class="text-accent" href="https://www.instagram.com/jshoonm/">Fran√ßois</a>.
